This project depends on CoreFoundation (on windows you can use the OpenCFLite repo)

It also depends on some build scripts that are outside this folder, these are available 
inside "CF.zip". To build, unzip them, and place then NEXT TO (outside of) the main directory
of this project, ie:

git proj folder
	CFTest
		readme.txt <-- this file
		** other files
	CF
		python
		** the python files from the zip file
